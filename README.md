## HW1 Due January 27th, 2023
### Part 0. ( 1 point) Complete this before changing any files.

1. Create a branch off of your Artificial-Inteligence-Spring-2023 repository on github called “HW1”.
2. Download a zip of the HW1 repository. (https://github.com/andrewboes/HW1)
3. Upload it to a folder called HW1 in your repository.

### Part 1. (20 points)

Given a binary tree, use breadth first search to return an integer that represents the maximum depth. A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. (see treeDepth.py for more info).

### Part 2. (20 points)

Exploratory data analysis: review the csv files in the degrees folder. Following the schema in the files, add a movie from IMDB that includes at least one actor from the existing list. (Hint: the IMDB url for Forest Gump is https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/)

Using breadth first search, complete the implementation of the shortest_path function in degrees.py such that it returns the shortest path from the person with id source to the person with the id target.

### Part 3. (1 point) Do not complete until you are mostly finsihed with the assignment.

Add a text file to the HW1 folder called “feedback.txt” and answer the following:

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
3. Did you work on it mostly alone or did you discuss the problems with others?
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%–100%)?
5. Any other comments?

Create a pull request from the HW1 branch to main and assign me as the reviewer.
